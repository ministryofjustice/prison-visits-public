        Terms and conditions
        --------------------

        ### General

        These terms and conditions affect your rights and liabilities under the
        law. They govern your use of, and relationship with, the digital prison

        or service which is linked to in this service.

        We may occasionally update these terms and conditions. This might happen
        if there’s a change in the law or to the way this service works. If
        there’s a change, you’ll be asked to agree to the new terms and

        ### Applicable law

        ### How to use this service responsibly

        There are risks in using a shared computer, such as in an internet café,
        to use this service. It’s your responsibility to be aware of these risks
        and to avoid using any computer which may leave your personal
        information accessible to others. You are responsible if you choose to
        leave a computer unprotected while in the process of making a prison
        visit request.

        We make every effort to check and test this service whenever we amend or
        update it. However, you must take your own precautions to ensure that
        the way you access this service does not expose you to the risk of
        viruses, malicious computer code or other forms of interference which
        may damage your own computer system.

        You must not misuse our service by knowingly introducing viruses,
        trojans, worms, logic bombs or other material which is malicious or
        technologically harmful. You must not attempt to gain unauthorised
        access to our service, the system on which our service is stored or any
        server, computer or database connected to our service. You must not
        attack our site via a denial-of-service attack or a distributed
        denial-of-service attack.

        ### Information provided by this service

        We work hard to ensure that information within this prison visit request
        service is accurate. However, we can’t guarantee the accuracy and
        completeness of any information at all times.

        While we make every effort to ensure this service is accessible at all
        times, we are not liable if it is unavailable for any period of time.

        ### How we use your information

        The Ministry of Justice (HM Prison Service) uses and retains the
        personal data of visitors for the purposes of the safe and secure
        provision of Prison Services, including those related to the management
        and rehabilitation of offenders.

        Access to the establishment can only be granted by supplying the
        prescribed information in order to ensure and maintain a safe and secure
        environment for all.

        You have the right to request details as to the personal information we
        hold for you; and subsequently request that we correct any personal
        information if it is found to be inaccurate or out of date. We will not
        share your information with other organisations unless it is required
        for the purposes of prevention, detection of crime, apprehension,
        prosecution, and management of offenders; prevention of terrorism;
        national security; or required to do by law.

        Separately from the information entered by those using this service, we
        also collect site-usage information which allows us to see how the
        service is being used in order to allow us to improve it. This
        information does not contain any personal data.

        It includes:

        -   questions, queries or feedback you leave, including your email
            address if you send a message via feedback
        -   your IP address, and details of which version of web browser you
            used
        -   information on how you use the site, using cookies and page tagging
            techniques to help us improve the website

        This helps us to:

        -   improve the site by monitoring how you use it
        -   respond to any feedback you send us, if you’ve asked us to
        -   provide you with information about local services if you want it

        We can’t personally identify you using your data.

        ### Where your data is stored

        We store your data on our secure servers in the UK. However, it may also
        be stored outside of Europe, where it could be viewed by our staff or
        suppliers. By submitting your personal data, you agree to this.

        We also use other suppliers to provide this service:

        -   [SendGrid](http://sendgrid.com) to relay information to prisons. See
            the [terms & conditions](http://sendgrid.com/tos) attached to
            this service.
        -   [ZenDesk](http://www.zendesk.com) to handle any feedback that
            you leave. See the [terms &
            conditions](http://www.zendesk.com/company/terms) attached to
            this service.

        ### Keeping your data secure

        Transmitting information over the internet is generally not completely
        secure, and we can’t guarantee the security of your data. We do however
        use SSL in order to encrypt all data transferred to and received from
        our server.

        We take data security very seriously and we take every step to ensure
        that your data remains private and secure.

        ### Any data you transmit is at your own risk.

        We have procedures and security features in place to try and keep your
        data secure once we receive it.

        We won’t share your information with any other organisations for
        marketing, market research or commercial purposes, and we don’t pass on
        your details to other websites.

        ### Disclosing your information

        We may pass on your personal information if we have a legal obligation
        to do so.

        ### How we manage sessions

        This service can be used to make a prison visit request. Your session is
        active for 20 minutes even if you close your browser, or navigate away
        from this service. During this time, personal information about you may
        be visible to anyone with access to your computer.

        Your data is held in memory during the duration of the session; this is
        cleared after 20 minutes of inactivity.

        ### Data Protection Act 1998

        This service complies with all principles of the DPA 1998.

        Ministry of Justice (MoJ) is the ‘data controller’ for the purposes of
        the Act. However, the information you enter into this service is not
        automatically transmitted to the Ministry of Justice, but is stored in a
        secure database. No personal data will be used in testing this service.

        Our hosting provider, and MoJ staff responsible for supporting this
        service, will have access to the server in which all personal
        information entered into this service is momentarily stored. All staff
        who have access to the secure data have MoJ security clearance.

        Anyone who believes their personal data is kept within this service has
        the right to submit a subject access request to the MoJ, who will give
        details of the information stored on the server.

        ### Disclaimer

        We don’t accept liability for loss or damage incurred by users of this
        service, whether direct, indirect or consequential, whether caused by
        tort, breach of contract or otherwise. This includes loss of income or
        revenue, business, profits or contracts, anticipated savings, data,
        goodwill, tangible property or wasted time in connection with this
        service or any websites linked to it and any materials posted on it.
        This condition shall not prevent claims for loss of or damage to your
        tangible property or any other claims for direct financial loss that are
        not excluded by any of the categories set out above.

        This does not affect our liability for death or personal injury arising
        from our negligence, nor our liability for fraudulent misrepresentation
        or misrepresentation as to a fundamental matter, nor any other liability
        which cannot be excluded or limited under applicable law.
